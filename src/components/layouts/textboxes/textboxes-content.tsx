          k8s, or React because we feel that we should work with the best
          technology available and support those that build it - Ory is using
          open source for almost everything. Work with technology you love and
          keep your skills as sharp & cutting edge as our tech stack.

          everyone has a voice and we seek input from the whole company on
          important decisions. You will also get insight and influence other
          areas of operation regardless of your position (dev, product,
          customers, marketing, community, etc.) Unlike at $BIGCORP, people care
          about what they are building. Don’t waste your life - build something
          that has real value.

          variety of customers, and building completely new things. You won’t
          just be another employee - You have a direct impact on Ory’s success
          and the team will support you, but also depend on you - together we
          succeed.
